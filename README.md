# Nodesqlite

A NSS classroom project introducing SQLite and Moment.js

### Goal

Engage in an exercise where we install SQLite to Node and make queries to our database file. Also, use Moment.js to filter dates.

### Tools Used

Node, Express, SQLite, Moment.js, Code editor

### Installation

Create new repository and enter the following command:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/threepears/nodesqlite.git
```

Run the following command to install all dependencies:

```sh
$ npm install
```

Now start your regular Node server with this Terminal command:

```sh
$ npm run start
```

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000/ to navigate to the two pages of data we queried in class.
